title: Accept recurring payments for your token-gated newsletter
description: We partner with Unlock Protocol to bring recurring payments to your newsletter.
---

We support using Unlock Protocol NFTs, so you can configure & accept recurring payments for your token-gated newsletter.

---

Connect your wallet to [Unlock Protocol](https://unlock-protocol.com).

Deploy a new Lock contract, then update your Lock settings to enable Renewals.

We also encourage generating an Unlock Protocol checkout URL, to allow users to purchase your Unlock Protocol recurring subscription.

Now, use the lock contract address to [token-gate your newsletter on Paragraph](/docs/token-gated-content) (ensuring you also include the Unlock checkout URL here), and you can now accept recurring subscriptions from your readers!
