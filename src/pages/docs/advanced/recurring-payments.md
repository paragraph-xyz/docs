We support collecting recurring payments for your newsletter in both fiat and crypto.

---

## Fiat

Navigate to the [Memberships & Gating page](https://paragraph.xyz/settings/publication/memberships-token-gating) and connect a Stripe account to begin accepting fiat recurring payments for paid memberships.

After connecting your Stripe account, you will see the option to manage your account which allows you to view your customers, invoices, etc in the Stripe dashboard as well as the option to disconnect your account which will disable the fiat recurring payment option.

## Crypto

Navigate to the [Memberships & Gating page](https://paragraph.xyz/settings/publication/memberships-token-gating) and connect a wallet to Loop to begin accepting crypto recurring payments for paid memberships. After connecting to Loop for the first time, you will receive an email to activate your Loop account and set a password. This is the login you will use later if you want to manage your Loop account.

**An email is not required to use crypto payments but you will not get a Loop account that gives you access to the Loop dashboard.**

After connecting to Loop, you will see the option to manage your account which allows you to view your customers, invoices, etc in the Loop dashboard, inputs to update your payment wallet and accepted networks and tokens, as well as the option to disconnect your account which will disable the crypto recurring payment option.
