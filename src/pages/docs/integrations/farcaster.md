description: Integrations between Paragraph & Farcaster.
---

Paragraph has a handful of different integrations with the [Farcaster protocol](https://www.farcaster.xyz/). We believe integrations with decentralized social networks such as Farcaster can unlock new & better ways for creators to permissionlessly distribute, engage, & monetize.

## Subscribe to your Farcaster followers

When you first connect your wallet to Paragraph, if that wallet is associated with a Farcaster account, we permissionlessly pull in all your followers & their Paragraph newsletters, letting you subscribe to them in one click. This provides another avenue for writers to grow, and for readers to discover great writers.

At any point after Paragraph account registration, visit [your account settings](https://paragraph.xyz/settings/account/social) to view this list.

## View your follower's posts

We showcase all your Farcaster followers' posts in a [dedicated feed](https://paragraph.xyz/discover/feed/for-you/farcaster), ensuring you never miss their latest long-form content.

You can also view _someone else's feed_, given their wallet address. For example, here is everyone that's following dwr: [https://paragraph.xyz/discover/feed/for-you/farcaster/0xD7029BDEa1c17493893AAfE29AAD69EF892B8ff2](https://paragraph.xyz/discover/feed/for-you/farcaster/0xD7029BDEa1c17493893AAfE29AAD69EF892B8ff2)

## Comments on Farcaster are displayed on Paragraph posts

Whenever a Paragraph post URL is shared on Farcaster, we permissionlessly pull in all discussion occurring on Farcaster, and display it directly on the post itself.

Most discussion of an article doesn't happen on the article itself -- it happens on social media. This integration allows writers & readers alike to view & join the conversation, even if it's happening elsewhere.

## Auto-summarizing & sharing your posts on Farcaster

We created [a bot](https://warpcast.com/paragraph) on Farcaster that summarizes & casts about your published posts. This bot uses ChatGPT to perform the summarization. This provides another avenue for distributing your content across all of Farcaster.

In order for this bot to cast your content, you need to have your Farcaster wallet address connected to your Paragraph account.
