Write alone, or write together. Learn how to create and manage a team on Paragraph.

Paragraph makes it easy to write collaboratively. With the teams feature, you can choose who can contribute to your publication - whether it's just two of you or a community of contributors.

On your [Team settings](https://paragraph.xyz/settings/publication/team), add a team member. You can include their crypto wallet address or their email address (or both).

When your team member logs into Paragraph (or creates an account if they haven't already), if their wallet address or email address matches what you added, they'll have the option of contributing directly to your publication.

Team members can access different publications via the drop-down menu in the bottom left.
