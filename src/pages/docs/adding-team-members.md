Write alone, or write together. Learn how to create and manage a team on Paragraph.

---

Paragraph makes it easy to write collaboratively. With the teams feature, you can choose who can control who can contribute to your publication - whether it's just two of you or an community of contributors.

On your [Team settings](https://paragraph.xyz/settings/publication/team), add a team member. You can include their Web3 wallet address or their email address (or both).

When your team member logs into Paragraph (or creates an account if they haven't already), if their wallet address or email address matches what you added, they'll have the option of contributing directly to your publication.
