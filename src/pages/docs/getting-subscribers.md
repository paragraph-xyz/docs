## Configuring Subscription Methods

The first step towards getting subscribers is configuring how they can subscribe to your publication. On your [Blog settings](https://paragraph.xyz/settings/publication/blog), decide which subscription methods to allow. By default, users can subscribe with their email but you can choose to allow them to subscribe with their email, wallet, or both. It is recommended to always allow users to subscribe with their email so that your newsletter will be delivered to them.
