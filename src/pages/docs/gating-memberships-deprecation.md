## Changes to Paid Memberships and Token-Gating Features

If you previously used Paragraph’s Loop or Stripe integration for paid memberships, this page provides information about the changes made to the gating and membership features.

## Overview of Changes

Paid Memberships:

- Paragraph no longer processes payments or takes a share of membership fees. Writers must manage new subscriptions or memberships through external tools like Loop and/or Stripe. Any prompt to purchase subscriptions would need to direct readers to external sites (e.g., Loop-hosted or Stripe-hosted page to purchase memberships).
- Existing paid subscribers will remain active unless canceled by the writer or publication admin. You can manage your paid memberships and token-gated memberships on your [Loop Dashboard](https://admin.loopcrypto.xyz/login) or on [Stripe](https://dashboard.stripe.com/).

Token-Gating:

- Posts gated by tokens are no longer supported on the platform.
- Token-based memberships must now be managed directly through external platforms, such as Loop Crypto.

Gated Posts:

- All posts previously gated by memberships or tokens have been moved to the writer’s **Archive** to prevent gated writing from being publicly accessible by default.
- Writers can choose to **remove gates** on their posts and publish them in full to their publication, making the writing accessible to all readers.

If you have further questions or need assistance managing existing subscriptions or gated posts, feel free to reach out to us at [hello@paragraph.xyz](mailto:hello@paragraph.xyz).

## For Readers with Paid Subscriptions

If you’re a reader with a paid subscription and wish to cancel, please contact the writer directly. If you’re unable to reach the writer, send a note to hello@paragraph.xyz and we’ll help connect you with the writer.
