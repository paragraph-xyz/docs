## Collectible Content

Allow readers to save and own any part of your posts by highlighting a sentence or paragraph and minting it as an NFT.

You maintain full control over the supply and cost of this content and can enable or disable it for your entire publication or on a per-post basis.

### Setting up collectible content

Before you can make your content colletible, you need to have a wallet connected to your Paragraph account.

In your Paragraph publication settings, you can [enable or disable this feature](https://paragraph.xyz/settings/publication/blog) for all your posts. You can also set the supply & cost of all collectibles.

When you publish a post, you can also configure the supply & cost using the new 'collectibles' tab in your post settings.

After a post is published, your readers can highlight any sentence or paragraph of your posts and choose to mint it as an NFT. This highlight is visible to other readers.


## Collectible Posts

Turn your entire post into a collectible. Coming soon!

## Embedded Collectibles

We integrate with [Highlight.xyz](https://tools.highlight.xyz) so you can create NFTs, embed them in your Paragraph posts, and send them directly to your readers. Read the [launch announcement](https://paragraph.xyz/@blog/highlight).

### Creating & embedding collectibles

Head to [Highlight](https://tools.highlight.xyz) and create a token.

Choose the chain, and set a name, symbol & description.

Upload an audio, video or image file.

Specify the edition size - fixed (to introduce scarcity) or unlimited.

Set a token price, start or end date, and optionally gate the NFT behind some conditions.

Hit mint, and you'll be given a collection URL that looks like this: https://mint.highlight.xyz/63be385a3de4fce815d44a17

Head on over to Paragraph, and paste that link directly into a new post. It'll turn into an embed!

Readers can connect their wallet to collect this NFT directly in your posts. When sent via email, your subscribers can click "Collect" to be directed to the mint.highlight.xyz page above.

### Example usecases

Embedding flexible NFTs unlocks a whole array of new usecases. For example:

* Turn every post into a time-limited NFT to incentivize readers to subscribe & collect

* Narrate your posts, then create & embed audio NFTs

* Reward your most loyal subscribers with gated NFT drops

* Create token-gated posts based on NFTs youâ€™ve embedded in previous posts. Your readers need to collect past content to view future content! (Is anyone excited about the first NFT-powered interactive novel?!)
