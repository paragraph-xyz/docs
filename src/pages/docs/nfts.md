## Creating NFTs with Highlight

Head to [Highlight](https://tools.highlight.xyz) and create a token.

Choose the chain, and set a name, symbol & description.

Upload an audio, video or image file.

Specify the edition size - fixed (to introduce scarcity) or unlimited.

Set a token price, start or end date, and optionally gate the NFT behind some conditions.

Hit mint, and you'll be given a collection URL that looks like this: https://mint.highlight.xyz/63be385a3de4fce815d44a17

Head on over to Paragraph, and paste that link directly into a new post. It'll turn into an embed!
